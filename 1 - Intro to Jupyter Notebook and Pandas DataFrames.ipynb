    "## Basic Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Pandas DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook provides a Python interface that has become very popular with data scientists because it blends text, code, and code execution into a single interface. It has a bit of a learning curve but has proven to be very powerful in practice. pandas Data Frames can be thought of as data objects that act like Excel spread sheets. In this tutorial we use pandas dataframes to manipulate our data.\n",

    "    * in cells that have not been executed you will see an In [ ]:\n",
    "    * in cells that are executing, or waiting to be executed you will see In[*]:\n",
    "    * in cells that have already been executed, you will see In[ <some number> ]: which indicates the order it was executed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's go ahead and execute the cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To run a cell, you can click the play button in the toolbar, or press *Shift + Enter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To stop an executing cell, click the square button in the tool bar. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try executing the cell below. It will keep running until you hit the stop button. Notice that there is a delay in stopping. The cell will not stop until the sleep has finished. "

    "Note: The KeyboardInterrupt Exception is a result of you terminating the cell. When you see a message like that, it is often a Python exception. Ignore the traceback and look at the bottom of the message for information about what caused the error. If you don't understand the error message, searching Google for that exact error message will often lead you to understanding what went wrong.\n",

    "Great, so far so good! Next, let's add a new cell. You will often want to add a cell in the notebook to try out executing some function or explore the data. To add a cell, click on insert in the toolbar, and select add cell below. In the cell that you create, go ahead create a test DataFrame for us to play with. Copy the following code into the cell you create and run the cell.\n",
